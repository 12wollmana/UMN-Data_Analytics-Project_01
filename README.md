# Billboard's Top 100 and Unemployment
<em>Kelsey Richardson Blackwell, Will Huang, & Aaron Wollman</em>

## Description
Does the U.S.’s economic health influence which songs are in the Top 100? 
If it is a more difficult year (ex. recession), do we listen to songs that are less happy?

## Research Questions
* Does the measure of “musical positiveness”in the Top 100 Hits and the US’s unemployment data have a strong correlation?  Is the correlation strong enough to predict next month?

* Does a low US unemployment rate produce more danceable music? Louder music? More energetic music?  What about other music attributes like acousticness, speechiness, etc?
