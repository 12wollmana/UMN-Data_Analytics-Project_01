# Code
This is the project's code.

## Import
The code within [data_import](data_import.ipynb) imports and cleans up the data from our [external sources](../data/external).
After cleanup, it is saved in the [data folder](../data) for use in our analysis.

## Analysis
The code within [data_analysis](data_analysis.ipynb) analyzes the data and is the main writeup for this project.

## API Keys
If needed, this is where we can put instructions on how to develop the API file for our own use.  If we decide to not use external APIs, we can delete this section of the readme.
