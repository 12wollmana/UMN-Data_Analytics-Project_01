# Code
This is the project's code.

## Import
The code within [data_import](data_import.ipynb) imports and cleans up the data from our [external sources](../data/external).
After cleanup, it is saved in the [data folder](../data) for use in our analysis.

## Analysis
The code within [data_analysis](data_analysis.ipynb) analyzes the data and is the main writeup for this project.

## How to Run
<ol>
  <li>In the terminal, initialize an Anaconda environment using "source activate <i>{your environment}</i>".</li>
  <li>Open Jupyter Notebook using "jupyter notebook" in the terminal.</li>
  <li>In the Jupyter Notebook, open the ipynb file that contains the code.</li>
  <li>
    With the code open, you have two options on how to run the code:
    <ul>
      <li>
        In the menu bar open Kernel > Restart and Clear Output.  Then you can use Shift+Enter to run the code one block at a time.
      </li>
      <li>In the menu bar open Kernel > Restart and Run All.  This will run all of the blocks of code at once.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>
